# Status Update - July 2025

The project now supports embeddable enrichment tables and an iframe snippet
button. A metrics feedback loop was introduced to analyze enrichment confidence
and adapt prompts. Documentation has been generalized with placeholder
variables defined in `VARIABLE_DICTIONARY.md`. Database setup instructions and
domain-agnostic examples were also added.
