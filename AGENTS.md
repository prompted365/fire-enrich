# Contribution Guidelines

- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before committing. The commands may fail
  if dependencies are missing, but should be attempted.
- Keep examples domain agnostic by referencing placeholders from
  `VARIABLE_DICTIONARY.md`.
- Place new documentation files in the repository root unless they belong in a
  feature directory.
